Dude, just finished watching Revelations and like... what even was that ending?? ðŸ˜‚ I mean, okay, it was kinda intense but also, so much happening and am I supposed to understand it all? Like, give my brain a rest, please! Anyway, the visuals were off the charts, right. But seriously, Wendy being all mysterious and stuff, did anyone see that coming? I sure didnâ€™t!

Honestly, I was so hyped to download the movie, but now I'm like, I need a detailed wiki or something just to absorb everything. Some bits, man, I was like, wait, what did they just say? Had to rewind a couple of times. And donâ€™t even get me started on the whole thing with the clock tower. That was wild! Can we talk about Jakeâ€™s hair though? ðŸ˜‚ What are they trying to say with that hairdo? Is it symbolic or... nah, just a choice?

> So now I'm wondering, is this like the official end? Because if it is, I don't know how to feel about it. Usually, I'm all about the open-ended stuff, but now itâ€™s like... give me some closure here, people! And the soundtrackâ€”so on point. Had goosebumps all the way. Tbh, I might just need to watch the movie again to get it all. Just give me a chance to catch my breath first.

And those fight scenes! Yikes! Pretty sure I stopped breathing during some of them. Also, are we ever gonna find out about the cat they keep showing? You know what I mean, right? It feels like a tease, or maybe they want us to think itâ€™s important. Ugh, my head's spinning from all the theories now.

function existentialCrisis() { return true; }

I guess that's it for now, my brain's officially fried. But like, if you've seen it, hit me up, I need someone to help me figure this mess out! What do you think? Is there a deeper meaning or just a bunch of loose ends?
